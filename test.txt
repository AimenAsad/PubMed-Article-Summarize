Intracellular pathogens, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis, survive inside host cells by avoiding or subverting the bactericidal mechanisms of the immune system. In particular, macrophages play a critical role in the innate immune response against tuberculosis (TB). Upon infection, macrophages initiate several antimicrobial pathways, including phagocytosis and autophagy, to control and eliminate the invading bacteria.

However, M. tuberculosis has evolved sophisticated strategies to evade these host defenses. The bacterium inhibits phagosome-lysosome fusion, allowing it to persist within the phagosome. Moreover, it manipulates host cell signaling pathways to prevent autophagy induction, thus maintaining its intracellular survival.

Understanding the interplay between M. tuberculosis and host macrophages is crucial for developing new therapeutic strategies against TB. Targeting bacterial evasion mechanisms and enhancing host immune responses are promising approaches to combat this persistent infection.

This article explores the molecular mechanisms underlying the evasion tactics of M. tuberculosis and discusses potential therapeutic interventions to improve TB treatment outcomes.
